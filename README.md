<h1>AspireMe</h1>

<p> Using my method of memorization and notes taking technique </p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p> I had problems in my studies and memorization where I would forget, but by using this system I could remember better. <br>
I would frequently test myself to remember to use things like flashcards in a fun and organized way. <br>
I always had this thing where I believed that if I made studying or just working on a task seem like playing video games, I'm sure I would remember and have fun in the process.
</p>

<h1>For Who?</h1>

<p> I mainly used this technique for exam preparation but grew to self-taught education and short notes that inspired or caught my eye from books, So I think <strong> students, hobbyists, and readers </strong> can benefit </p>

<h1> How? </h1>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h5>Create a folder </h5> 
  </li>
  
  <li> 
    <h5>Create A Document</h5> 
    <p>Has a list of notes that seem like one page</p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Create A Note</h5> 
    <p>Is in the document that seems like one page but is not</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h5>Based on the note make a quick flashcard</h5> 
    <p> To help the user to remember the app will pick the notes that need to be memorized based on if you were correct last time and how long it has been.</p> 
  </li>
  
  <li><h5>Can sync with firebase</h5>
  <p>To back up data</p>
  </li>
  
</ul>
