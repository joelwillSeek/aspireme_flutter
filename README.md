<h1>AspireMe</h1>

<p> Using my method of memorization and notes taking technique </p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p> I had problems in my studies and memorization where I would forget, but by using this system I could remember better. <br>
I would frequently test myself to remember to use things like flashcards in a fun and organized way. <br>
I always had this thing where I believed that if I made studying or just working on a task seem like playing video games, I'm sure I would remember and have fun in the process.
</p>

<h1>For Who?</h1>

<p> I mainly used this technique for exam preparation but grew to self-taught education and short notes that inspired or caught my eye from books, So I think <strong> students, hobbyists, and readers </strong> can benefit </p>

<h1> How? </h1>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h5>Create a folder( use the Second Brain System ) </h5> 
    <p>This helps the user organize notes and to know which notes to focus on to remember </p> 
  </li>
  
  <li> 
    <h5>Create A note with a title/question</h5> 
    <p>Helps the user question themselves using the title or questions and check if they were right.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h5>Based on the note make a quick flashcard</h5> 
    <p> To help the user to remember the app will automatically and randomly pick the notes that need to be memorized based on if you were correct last time and how long it has been.</p> 
  </li>
  
  <li> <h5>  Then if the flashcard is answered then increase the duration </h5>
  <p> In research I found that one of the ways to remember is to use a thing called spaced repetition which means to repeat something in an increasingly spaced timeline if I answer a question today then I will ask myself the next week then if I do answer again then after a one month in will ask myself</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><h5>When creating notes upload them to Google Drive with your account</h5>
  <p>To be able to use your notes at any time and on any devices</p>
  </li>
  
</ul>
